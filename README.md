## üîç Overview

### Neomorphic multi step form

This **multi step form** allows user to **find the perfect book** by providing information about his/her reading preferences. The form is divided in a few steps. The challenge in this project was to create an interface **in line with the neumorphism trend**.

&nbsp;

## :bulb: Features

- **find the perfect book** through a form with the following steps:
    - welcome - display of general information for the user
    - personal data of the user
    - literature category selection
    - size selection and information whether the book should be a new release
    - summary based on user input
- **all fields are validated** with custom data validator - the user **is kept informed about errors**
- **custom progress bar** showing the level of completion of the form
- **dark & light theme** - selection with a custom switcher component
